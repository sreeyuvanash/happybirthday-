            <h1>Hey There!</h1>
            <p>Hope you would have a greate day. You and me are being good friends over 6 months and I think due to some 
                things we are not having a good conversation as before. I don't know aboud you but I really miss you a lot
                as a FRIEND and I request you to forget everything I talked a few months ago and we can start our relationship
                as a FRIEND from start. I was happy when we are being friends but I have more problems and not having a good 
                friend to share everything. Let us start our old friendship from first from your Birthday.
            </p>
